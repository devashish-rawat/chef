I had enjoyed the long long int range 10^9 in cpp. BigInteger is the way to do it in Java. [Geometry.java] <br />
The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex - 1. [Lapindromes.java] <br />
If only one values is provided to the substring method it treats it as the begin index. [Lapindromes.java] <br />
.nextInt() before .nextLine() should have a scan.next() in b/w as .nextInt() deos not consider \n and \n(empty string) is accepted by the .nextLine(). [Lapindromes.java] <br />
