# basic
- I had enjoyed the long long int range 10^9 in cpp. Try using long and BigInteger in Java. [Geometry.java] <br />
# input
- Using BufferedReader for faster input [TransformExpression.java]
# strings
- The substring begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the character at index endIndex - 1. [Lapindromes.java] <br />
- If only one values is provided to the substring method it treats it as the begin index. [Lapindromes.java] <br />
- .nextInt() before .nextLine() should have a scan.next() in b/w as .nextInt() deos not consider \n and \n(empty string) is accepted by the .nextLine(). [Lapindromes.java] <br />
# stack
- Stack Operations [TransformExpression.java]
- popping an empty stack throws an exception [TransformExpression.java]
- pop returns the element that is popeed i.e has a return type [TransformExpression.java]
